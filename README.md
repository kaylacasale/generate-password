## generate-password
A public platform that generates a random password of your desired length and character type(s).
➬
## Creation 👩🏼‍💻
I developed this web application from scratch, deciding not to refactor given starter code to allow complete control over the programming and design process while adhering to all user stories and code requirements. While this password-generator exerts true and complete randomness over which Upper Case, Lower Case, Special Character, and Numbers will be generated and included in the password, it also allows users to pick desired password lengths (the given password range is between 8 and 128 characters in length).

## Application 🤝
🔘 Companies that build their own portal management systems, and have password restrains on length and types of characters.

🔘 Inventory protocols that require local pins/barcodes for employee use that need to be fit on standard-sized items (e.g. computers, COVID tests, etc.).

## User Story
AS a web developer targeting employees with access to sensitive data

I WANT to randomly generate a password

SO THAT I can create a strong password for users that provides greater security

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am a user in need of a new, secure password

WHEN I click the button to generate a password

THEN I am presented with a series of propmts for password criteria

WHEN prompted for password criteria

THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

WHEN prompted for the length of the password

THEN I choose a length of at least 8 charactera and no more than 128 characters before pressing "Enter"

WHEN asked for character types to include in the password

THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters, by selecting the "Generate Random" button associated with each character type

WHEN I generate random variables for a desired character type

THEN I can see which random values were generated beneath "☈" 

WHEN I want to see all random values more cohesively

THEN I click the "ADD Upper Case" button to add these values to the black board directly below the displayed character length

WHEN I answer each prompt

THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

WHEN all prompts are answered

THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

WHEN I click the icon "🔓" and generate the password 

THEN the password is displayed right above the black board, in place of the icon "🔗"
