## generate-password
A public platform that generates a random password of your desired length and character type(s).
➬
## Creation 👩🏼‍💻
I developed this web application from scratch, deciding not to refactor given starter code to allow complete control over the programming and design process while adhering to all user stories and code requirement- with one qualifying factor. While this password-generator exerts true randomness over which Upper Case, Lower Case, Special Character, and Numbers will be generated, it also allows users to pick desired password lengths (the given password range is between 8 and 128 characters in length).

## Application 🤝
🔘 Companies that build their own portal management systems, and have password restrains on length and types of characters.

🔘 Inventory protocols that require local pins/barcodes for employee use that need to be fit on standard-sized items (e.g. computers, COVID tests, etc.).
